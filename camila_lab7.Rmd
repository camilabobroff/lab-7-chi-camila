This: I'm Camila and I'm updating this markdown file here. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
gc_df <- read_csv("gc_df.csv")

```

We are asking: Is there a signficant difference in recommended gun control action for male and female respondents (should guns be easier, harder, or the same difficulty to get)?

Hi Camila :) I am going to test if you can see these changes.

Camila: data wrangling and counts

```{r}
get_guns <- gc_df %>% 
  filter(gender != "NA", make_get_guns != "NA") %>% 
  count(gender, make_get_guns)
```
